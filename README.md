# DSA-Codes
Notes and codes from the Alpha course + bonus problems by Apna College In TypeScript.

## Prerequisites

#### Required
- have <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/build-javascript-applications-typescript">basic understanding of TypeScipt</a> (this includes topics such as generics, data types, typed arrays, interfaces, etc).
- know basic data types and structures in JS/TS such as arrays, strings, objects, AND know basic methods.
#### Optional/Good to Have
- Have some basic understanding of <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/time-complexity-and-space-complexity/">time complexity and space complexity</a>, knowing linear, quadratice, cubic TC/SC and logarithmic TC suffices.
- Know git (not used anywhere in files, just makes it easy to look across the files).


## A Small Guide
- To copy the files to your local system, use
   ~~~
    git clone https://github.com/gurlakshpreetKaur/DSA-Codes
   ~~~
- If at any point, you don't understand an inbuilt method that I used, Google it, or go to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">W3Schools</a> and look for the method in the JS section.
- If you don't understand why/how a certain algorithm works, dry run it.
- On subjects such as OOPS and TC, I have provided resouces, in the form of links, that you should read if you don't have a clear-cut understanding of the topic.
- For each question, if I was able to find the question on leetCode, I've put the link there.
- Bonus leetCode problem links are also given, which you may solve.
- For each question, remember to not write the code side-by-side. If you don't know the solution, then first read the entire code, understand how/why it works by reading comments and/or dry running, when try to write it from your understanding. DO NOT JUST LOOK AT THE CODE AND TRY TO MEMORISE IT.
