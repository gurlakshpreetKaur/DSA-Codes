Time Complexity And Space Complexity refer to the number of commands and the space in memory needed for an algorithm
    to run WITH RELATION TO INPUT SIZE.

This is something fairly theoretical, so writing code won't help much, so I'm sharing resources which you can read
    and understand-

    Space Complexity is usually very easily to derive, it is Time Complexity that tends to be more complex, so
        here are some practice questions-
