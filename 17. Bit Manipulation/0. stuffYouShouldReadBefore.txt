=> What is binary in the context of computers?
    Binary is a word that means 'related to 2'. Modern computers use binary number systems as their core. That means
    everything you see, is stored and computed by your copmuter in binary. Everything you type and click, or
    any calculation requires your computer to first convert it into binary, only then can the computer work with it.
    We, in the real world, commonly use the decimal number system. We have 10 digits- 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
    And we form numbers with them. Al the numbers you know and love can we formed with them, no matter how large.
    The binary number system as 2 numbers- 0, and 1. These 0s and 1s can also build numbers, no matter how large.
    0s represent false, 1s represent true, and this way, electricity is used to perform calculations (dont quote
    me on that, thats just something someone told me once).

=> Why should we learn about binary?
    1. Your working with computers, computers work with binary, so it would be polite to learn about binary.
    2. If you do 5+6, your computer has to convert it into binary, then perform the computation, then convert it
        back to decimal and return it (this, actually is why if you do 0.3 + 0.4 in python, you wont get 0.7,
        you would get 0.699, as the result of change number systems so often). That is a lot of steps. If you learn
        about binary, and binary operations, you could reduce the number of steps thereby making certain parts
        of code faster.
