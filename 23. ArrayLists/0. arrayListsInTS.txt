TS is based on JS, and JS is a very dynamic language. In JS, arrays can be as long as we want it to.
In TS, we can tighten the bounds, by settings fixed sizes and data types.

So TS is the reverse of Java in this case. Java starts as a very strict language, and TS starts as a loose language.
You can use ArrayLists in Java to loosen the bound, in TS, you can use the data types and size to tighten in.

So working with ArrayLists in Java is the same as working with a simple array in TS. Which will make this chapter
pretty easy for us.

So here I've skipped the questions that we already know (such as sorting and reversing).

Topics that have been skipped-
1. Operations on ArrayLists
2. Size of ArrayList
3. Print reverse
4. Find Maximum
5. Swap 2 Numbers
6. Sorting an ArrayList
7. Pair Sum (already covered in '13. Arrays' practice problems, as a bonus question- 2Sum
