We already know how an LL can become circular.
if you take its last node, and make its next some other in the LL, it becomes circular.
here, we'll talk about the head node. the process is same for head node.

BUT if you want to make a DLL circular, for all nodes except the head, it is simple. you set next of tail to that
    specific node. BUT for the head node, there are 2 steps- 1. set next of tail to head. 2. set prev of head to
    tail. this is just to maintain consistency, as if next of tail is head, then prev of head MUST BE TAIL in a DLL.
