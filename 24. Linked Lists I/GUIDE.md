# Guide To This Chapter's Files

This chapter has a single code file, containing all the codes, which may get confusing and long when trying to study them, so here's a small guide.

- Interpret each method as a different question. 
- So go to each method, read the task, the comments, and the code. 
- Then try to code the method yourself from your understanding. 
- If you get stuck, go back and read the entire code from that point. Then come back and try to code it again. Repeat this process until you understand everything.
- If the comments just aren't enough, feel free to go and seach it on GeeksForGeeks.
- In each method, I have included a link to the leetCode link for that question, if I was able to find it. 
- The TC and SC for each algorithm is also given.
- Bonus questions are labeled with [BONUS] [BONUS] [BONUS]... [BONUS]. They are optional but mostly pretty easy so try them as well.
